# About
An urban traffic simulator designed to changes in traffic with variable street designs.

# Planning 
- Goal: Create a simulation to maximize traveler throughput and costs of different street layouts with different transportation modes
- Could do simulation over generic city or use google earth to simulate traffic flow over already existing street patterns (and what modifications to street layout and/or transportation modes to increase efficiency)
- Could use google earth / maps to take real life city layout and put into number form
- Considerations: need to get real life traffic throughputs for various modes from somewhere, need to domino effect of adjusting one street on all others
- Consider human behavior / adoption of new transportation modes
- Consider adjusting costs / taxes /subsidies on certain transportation modes
- Could extend into macro solution above
- Consider induced demand
